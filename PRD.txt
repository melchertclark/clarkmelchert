## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Product Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a personal website featuring a dynamic, visually engaging background composed of user videos, along with foreground content designed for a blog, external links, and archived writings. The website is designed primarily as a portfolio and personal content hub.

### User Story

As the website owner, I want to showcase myself through a visually appealing dynamic carousel of personal videos on my homepage background, enhancing my personal brand and identity. Additionally, I need a blog and structured space to archive and display various writings, projects, and links to external platforms.

### Functional Requirements

- **Dynamic Background Carousel**

  - Infinite, looping carousel of videos.
  - Grid layout, flexible to accommodate various video orientations (landscape and vertical).
  - Uniform video heights, with widths adjusted proportionally.
  - Consistent and deliberate white space between videos for a clean yet intentionally congested layout.
  - Background should be white for visual clarity.
  - Videos autoplay, muted, and looping continuously.

- **Foreground Content Card**

  - Floating, scroll-triggered appearance.
  - White or slightly off-white background.
  - Minimal translucency, providing subtle visibility of the video carousel edges.
  - Smooth transitions upon scrolling interactions.
  - Primary content includes:
    - Blog section
    - External links (social media, publications, projects)
    - Archiving section to aggregate writings

### Styling and Design Specifications

- **General Appearance**

  - Clean, minimalistic aesthetic.
  - Light, airy visual feel.

- **Carousel Styling**

  - White background.
  - Equal spacing (white space) between videos horizontally and vertically.
  - Congested video alignment for visual interest.
  - Videos displayed at a consistent height, variable width.
  - Blurred or softened playback option to enhance foreground readability.

- **Content Card Styling**

  - Rounded corners and subtle box-shadow for depth.
  - Central alignment with generous margins.
  - Comfortable readability (good contrast, legible fonts).

### Technical and Implementation Constraints

- **Local Development**

  - Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optionally React/Vue/Svelte).
  - Lightweight development workflow without build complexity preferred.
  - Testing done via VS Code Live Server or Python HTTP server locally.

- **Deployment and Hosting Strategy**

  - Deployed using GitHub Pages for zero cost and simplicity.
  - Domain hosting configured via Namecheap domain pointing through CNAME records.
  - No server-side scripts or databases; fully static website.

###

### Go-To-Market Strategy

- Rapid prototype developed and iteratively refined locally.
- Immediate deployment to GitHub Pages to validate public accessibility.
- Continuous refinement based on personal use and feedback.
